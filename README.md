# random-sensor-list
* A Max MSP patch that outputs a random list of sensor names. There may be 1, 2, 3, or 4 sensor names in the list, depending on which button you press. I used this as a way to brainstorm ideas for new Digital Musical Instrument designs, like a digital equivalent of drawing names out of a hat. 
* The yellow button resets the [urn] objects.
